# Touchless-Doorbell
INTRODUCTION
Social distancing is the one of the best method to escape from COVID 19. But we can’t avoid some emergency visits to some homes. When we arrive at infront of a house, first we search the doorbell button/ callingbell button and press the button. But in this special situation this doorbell button can cause the virus to spread. When infected person press the button the virus hold on that button and when a non infected person touch this button the virus spread to that person. We can avoid this danger by using the touchless doorbell. The existing doorbell can be converted to a touchless doorbell.

ABSTRACT
The method to effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at the local level due to contact with any surfaces has been introduced. Our innovation- a device called ‘Touch-less Doorbell’ can well prove to be an essential safety shield for the common public in their fight against this pandemic. This idea of the contactless doorbell will stand out from con ventional ones installed in our houses in terms of being durable, energy efficient and cost-effective. Once an infected person uses the doorbell,the virus holds onto that and spreads accordingly when an uninfected person touches the same. The existing doorbell itself can be reused by
integrating some power electronics components without entirely replacing the existing one. A detailed cost analysis of the proposed model has also been performed concluding it to be a budget friendly option without compromising on the product’s quality.

AIM AND SCOPE
To develop a touchless doorbell using the arduino board
 
PROBLEM SCOPE
• Owner has to go near to the door, and/or open it to address the need.
• Thieves will come to know ,if the owner is not in home when they
 do not answer.
• Doorbell buttons are usually exposed to the weather and while many models come with a waterproof outdoor unit, moisture and condensation sometimes can cause 
  malfunctions.
 • Vulnerable to covid virus in case of using manual doorbell.
 
SOLUTION STATEMENT
So in order to overcome these limitations ,we are going to use touchless doorbell using the arudino board which can be implemented easily.

OBJECTIVE
This would help a person in the house to notify if someone standing outside the door .The alarm will start ringing when a man come nearer to door to knock it at that time sensors will help to detect the person in front of it. Instead of traditional door bell the man at door is not in need to press the door bell button. The IR sensor automatically detects the person. It’s helpful as it’s an automatic system.
 
Project Design
The purpose of the design is to plan the solution of a problem specified by the requirements documents. This phase is the first step moving from problem to the 
solution domain. In other words, starting with what is needed design takes us to work how to satisfy the needs the design of the system is perhaps the most critical factor affecting the quality of the output and has a major impact on the later phases.

CONCLUSION
When the temperature is higher than the normal body temperature it senses the temperature and based on the distances the alarm beeps
